# US-police-shootings
## 1st Capstone Project of Turing College

### Introduction

Police brutality is a major issue in United States for decades. The purpose of this project is to gain insights and share possible improvements to reduce the fatal police shootings in the future.

### Data

Population distribution by race / ethnicity (2015-2019) [KFF](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/distribution-by-raceethnicity/?dataView=1&currentTimeframe=0&selectedRows=%7B%22wrapups%22:%7B%22united-states%22:%7B%7D%7D%7D&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22desc%22%7D)  

### Tasks

* To perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* To perform Statistical Hypothesis Testing
* To perform Modeling
